# Making Requests

All GraphQL requests go to a single endpoint. You MUST use the `POST` method for all requests.

```
https://api.sound.xyz/graphql
```

## Requirements

### Client API Key

An API key looks something like `f3740c4a-c8b1-31c1-ca14-5a3cc121537c`. These do not grant any special privileges associated
with your public address but do allow access to our API.

Every request MUST include the key with the `X-Sound-Client-Key` header.

```
X-Sound-Client-Key: f3740c4a-c8b1-31c1-ca14-5a3cc121537c
```

### Content Type

The content type of the request MUST be `application/json`.

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

## An example request

### Get a list of genres

We're going to use the following `Query`:

```graphql
query getReleaseGenres {
  releaseGenres {
    name
  }
}
```

We need to encode that request as a JSON object with a single `query` key.

```json
{ "query": "query getReleaseGenres { releaseGenres { name }" }
```

Making that request using `curl`:

```sh
curl 'https://api.sound.xyz/graphql' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Sound-Client-Key: f3740c4a-c8b1-31c1-ca14-5a3cc121537c' --data-binary '{"query":"query getReleaseGenres { releaseGenres { name }"}'
```

You will receive the following response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "releaseGenres": [
      {
        "name": "Rock"
      },
      {
        "name": "Drum & Bass"
      },
      {
        "name": "Techno"
      },
      {
        "name": "Dubstep"
      },
      {
        "name": "Trap"
      },
      {
        "name": "Metal"
      },
      {
        "name": "R&B & Soul"
      },
      {
        "name": "Hip-hop & Rap"
      },
      {
        "name": "Disco"
      },
      {
        "name": "Latin"
      },
      {
        "name": "Dance & EDM"
      },
      {
        "name": "Folk & Singer-Songwriter"
      },
      {
        "name": "Deep House"
      },
      {
        "name": "Indie"
      },
      {
        "name": "Dancehall"
      },
      {
        "name": "Ambient"
      },
      {
        "name": "Pop"
      },
      {
        "name": "World"
      },
      {
        "name": "Soundtrack"
      },
      {
        "name": "House"
      },
      {
        "name": "Reggaeton"
      },
      {
        "name": "Alternative Rock"
      },
      {
        "name": "Electronic"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
