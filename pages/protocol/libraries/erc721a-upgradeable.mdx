# ERC721AUpgradeable

**[`erc721a-upgradeable/contracts/ERC721AUpgradeable.sol`](https://github.com/chiru-labs/ERC721A-Upgradeable/blob/main/contracts/ERC721AUpgradeable.sol)**

NFT contract base implementation.

## Structs

### TokenOwnership

```solidity
struct TokenOwnership {
    // The address of the owner.
    address addr;
    // Keeps track of the start time of ownership with minimal overhead for tokenomics.
    uint64 startTimestamp;
    // Whether the token has been burned.
    bool burned;
}
```

Holds ownership data for each token.

`startTimestamp` is the timestamp when the token is minted to, transferred to, or burned by `addr`.

## Write Functions

### transferFrom

```solidity
function transferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 tokenId
) public virtual override
```

Transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`.

**Calling conditions:**

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`.
- If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either `approve` or `setApprovalForAll`.

Emits a `Transfer` event.

| Params:   |                           |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| `from`    | The source address.       |
| `to`      | The destination address.  |
| `tokenId` | The token ID to transfer. |

### safeTransferFrom

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 tokenId,
    bytes memory _data
) public virtual override
```

Safely transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`, checking first that contract recipients are aware of the ERC721 protocol to prevent tokens from being forever locked.

The `data` parameter is forwarded in `IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received` to contract recipients (optional, default: `""`).

**Calling conditions:**

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`.
- If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either `approve` or `setApprovalForAll`.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement `IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received`, which is called upon a safe transfer.

Emits a `Transfer` event.

| Params:   |                                                                                                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `from`    | The source address.                                                                                        |
| `to`      | The destination address.                                                                                   |
| `tokenId` | The token ID to transfer.                                                                                  |
| `_data`   | Optional data to be passed into the `IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received` function of the receiving contract. |

### approve

```solidity
function approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) public override
```

Gives permission to `to` to transfer `tokenId` token to another account. The approval is cleared when the token is transferred.

Only a single account can be approved at a time, so approving the zero address clears previous approvals.

**Calling conditions:**

- The caller must own the token or be an approved operator.
- `tokenId` must exist.

Emits an `Approval` event.

| Params:   |                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| `to`      | The address to approve.      |
| `tokenId` | The token ID to approve for. |

### setApprovalForAll

```solidity
function setApprovalForAll(
    address operator,
    bool approved
) public virtual override
```

Approve or remove `operator` as an operator for the caller. Operators can call `transferFrom` or `safeTransferFrom` for any token owned by the caller.

**Calling conditions:**

- The `operator` cannot be the caller.

Emits an `ApprovalForAll` event.

| Params:    |                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `operator` | The operator's address.             |
| `approved` | Whether the `operator` is approved. |
