# Sound Protocol

The Sound Protocol is a permissionless, open-source, modular smart contract framework for efficient creation of digital collectibles by musicians, artists, and creators.

[Sound Protocol Github repo](https://github.com/soundxyz/sdk)

## Features

### Permissionless

<IndentedParagraph>Anyone can freely deploy Sound contracts.</IndentedParagraph>

### Non-upgradeable contracts

<IndentedParagraph>
  All contracts are non-upgradeable, which gives artists and collectors greater confidence in the security and
  sovereignty of the communities they can build on Sound.
</IndentedParagraph>

### Customizable metadata

<IndentedParagraph>
  Artists and developers are free to implement custom metadata modules to suit their needs.
</IndentedParagraph>

### Customizable mint formats

<IndentedParagraph>
  Mint formats can be customized on a per-song basis by utilizing minter module contracts.
</IndentedParagraph>

### Customizable payments & royalties

<IndentedParagraph>
  With each song as its own contract, Sound Protocol supports end-to-end royalties across primary and secondary sales.
  Any address can be set to receive the edition’s revenue, be it the artist’s wallet or a payment splitter contract.
</IndentedParagraph>

### Gas efficient

<IndentedParagraph>
  A great amount of effort was made toward making the Sound Protocol gas efficient. See [gas
  benchmarks](/protocol/overview/gas) section for details.
