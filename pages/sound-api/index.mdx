# Getting Started

The Sound API uses GraphQL to serve indexed event data from Sound Protocol, including metadata like image and audio URLs. It is a convenient way to integrate Sound data directly into your own tech stack.

## About GraphQL

If you are new to GraphQL, you should take some time to become familiar with the basic concepts and usage.

You can learn more by visiting [Introduction to GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn).

If you are ready to jump in you can check out [making requests](/sound-api/making-requests) or browse our [API Explorer](/api-explorer).

## Acquiring an API key
